1 . How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

-- I spent two full days on the coding test, making sure I covered everything. If I had more time, I'd make the code work even better, work on design part and add extra functionalities to make it even better.


2.How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

-- If there's a problem with performance in production, I'd look at the logs and performance data to find out where the issue is. Even though I haven't had to do this before, I know it involves careful analysis and using tools to figure out what's slowing things down.

3.Please describe yourself using JSON.
